## 🙋🏼‍♂️ About me 

Hi, I’m Nutthawoot, a Public Health Analyst based in Bangkok, Thailand. I’ve worked alongside government agencies, NGOs, and international partners to strengthen public health systems through research, policy, and cross-sector collaboration. I'm particularly interested in turning health data into meaningful insights. I work with tools like **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and **Tableau** to develop practical solutions and engaging visualizations.

### 🧪 Featured Projects

- 📊 **Health Program Dashboards** – Interactive tools to monitor key health indicators  
- 🦟 **Malaria Surveillance Analysis** – Trend exploration using statistical and spatial methods  
- 💉 **Vaccine Hesitancy Research** – Behavioral data insights to inform policy  
- 🗺 **Geo-Spatial Visualizations** – Mapping healthcare access for underserved areas

📚 I’m always learning and open to collaboration—especially on data-driven projects in health, development, or sustainability.
